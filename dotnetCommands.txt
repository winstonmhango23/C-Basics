dotnet new console -o ./CsharpProjects/TestProject //creates a new project
dotnet build //to build the project
The dotnet build command builds the project and its dependencies into a set of binaries. The binaries include the project's code in Intermediate Language (IL) files with a .dll extension. Depending on the project type and settings, other files may also be included
dotnet run //to run the compiled code

The dotnet run command runs source code without any explicit compile or launch commands. It provides a convenient option to run your application from the source code with one command. It's useful for fast iterative development from the command line. The command depends on the dotnet build command to build the code
